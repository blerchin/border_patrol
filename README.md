Border Patrol

-------------
Border Patrol is the online manifestation of a video I produced in December 2012. The 12-hour-long video documents a 'flight' in Google Earth's Flight Simulator mode along the border of the USA's 48 contiguous states, beginning and ending just south of San Diego, CA. The section of the video you are seeing now corresponds to the time of day, so if you return in three hours time, the frame you see will probably be pointing in a different cardinal direction. Likewise, if you come back in twelve hours you will see the same part of the border you see now. You are invited to stop by as often as you like.

This repo includes the code (Ruby and JS) used to load and display the right part of the video at the right time (not easy to do in a cross-browser way)!
