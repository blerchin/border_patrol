	<h2>What is this?</h2>
	<p>
	<i>Border Patrol</i> is the online manifestation of a video produced by digital media artist <a href="http://benlerchin.com">Ben Lerchin</a>. The 12-hour-long video documents a 'flight' in Google Earth's Flight Simulator mode along the border of the USA's 48 contiguous states, beginning and ending just south of San Diego, CA. The section of the video you are seeing now corresponds to the time of day, so if you return in three hours time, the video you see will probably be pointing towards a different cardinal direction. Likewise, if you come back in twelve hours you will see the same part of the border you see now.

	For those of us who live on the right side of a national border, the existence of such a thing may seem a trite and abstract notion&mdash;an artifact of a bygone era. Many of the major technological advances of the 20th Century, and the resulting changes in the way we move, communicate, trade, and fight with each other, have contributed to the dissolution of many borders, both physical and intangible. In the United States, we police our borders with a vengence, yet dedicate tremendous resources to waging war on foreign soil. This contradiction cannot hold forever.

	It is comforting to think of borders and the ownership they imply, but what if this metaphor is reaching the end of its useful life? One of the revelations of the digital age is that it requires far more energy to protect property than to share it. This is tragic as regards intellectual property. What of property in the traditional sense? What are the responsibilites that come with owning a place?
